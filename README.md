# middleware

Just a collection of middlewares that i use from time to time.  
better to have them here all together.  

## Lowercase
turns the path to lowercase, sometimes is useful to make no distintion between `/blog/posts` and `/Blog/Posts`.  

## CORS
cors allow everything, useful for debugging (use https://github.com/rs/cors for prod please).

## JSONContentType
sets the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`
